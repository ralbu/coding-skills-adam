# Numeric types
## Exercise 1.1
- Write a function, call it `guessing_game`. Write the code in the folder *python/workout/ex1/ex1_guessing_game.py*
- When run, the function chooses a random integer between 0 and 100 (inclusive)
- Then ask the user to guess what number has been chosen
- Each time the user enters a guess, the program indicates one of the following:
    - Too high
    - Too low
    - Just right
- If the user guesses correctly, the program exits. Otherwise, the user is asked to try again
- The program only exits after the user guesses correctly

**Bonus**
- At the end of the game, as the user if he/she wants to play again. If yes then start a new game, otherwise exist
- Modify the program so that it gives the user only 3 chances to guess the correct number
- Modify the program to ask the user which Level:
  - Beginner - allows 10 chances to guess the correct number
  - Intermediate - allows 10 chances to guess the correct number
  - Expert - allows 3 chances to guess the correct number
