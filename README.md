## Exercise 1.1
- Write a function, call it `guessing_game`
- When run, the function chooses a random integer between 0 and 100 (inclusive).
- Then ask the user to guess what number has been chosen.
- Each time the user enters a guess, the program indicates one of the following:
    - Too high
    - Too low
    - Just right
- If the user guesses correctly, the program exits. Otherwise, the user is asked to try again.
- The program only exits after the user guesses correctly.

** Bonus **

- Modify the program so that it gives the user only 3 chances to guess the correct number
- Modify the program to ask the user which Level:
  - Beginner - allows 10 chances to guess the correct number
  - Intermediate - allows 10 chances to guess the correct number
  - Expert - allows 3 chances to guess the correct number
